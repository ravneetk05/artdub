<div class="para" ><p><b>"Working at the intersection of painting and weaving has an abstracting effect and makes room for more expression."
    Melissa English Campbell is a visual artist known for blending traditional weaving techniques with painting to create woven portraits and landscapes that shift into abstraction and geometric patterning. Inspired by abstract impressionist painters, she explores our relationships with society and the environment.
    <br><br>
    “Weaving requires the orderly movement of multiple methodical systems to transform yarn into a stable structure,” Melissa explains.
    <br><br>
    By painting directly onto the yarns before weaving, she introduces chance and disruption into the mechanical, creating dynamic pieces that reflect the psychological states we experience when asking deeper questions.
    <br><br>
    Through her intricate and thoughtful process, her work invites viewers to engage with these visual conversations, where patterns are both disrupted and redefined.
    <br><br>
    Artwork Archive had the chance to chat with Melissa about her creative process, how she came to combine these two mediums, and how Artwork Archive helps her manage her art career. ​ 
    You can see more of her work on Discovery and learn more about her art practice below:

    Can you walk us through your creative process? Do you have a favorite part of your process?
    Most pieces start with a dream.
    <br><br>
    In my dream, moods, patterns, stories, people, colors and shapes weave in and out of each other, and eventually, I see a way to recreate it in my studio.
    <br><br>
    I make some sketches and get to work painting yarns, weaving, and working back into the woven surface.
    My favorite part is painting, but I also find weaving really grounding, so that is a favorite part of the process too.
    
    <br><br>
    
    How did you first discover the connection between weaving and painting and what inspired you to blend them in your practice? 
    In grad school, I learned to dye yarn and weave.
    <br><br>
    I realized that if I could thicken the dye, I could paint with it and achieve a wider range of effects on the loom than what I was getting from dunking the yarn into dye pots.
    After a few years of trial and error, I've developed a system and formula that works well for me.

    You reference early Impressionist painters and sculptors. Can you elaborate on what aspects of their approach resonate with you?
    I resonate with the early Impressionist painters who focused on the fleeting, momentary experiences of a scene.
    <br><br>
    My portraits also depict the momentary—whether it's a feeling, thought, or movement—and feature a lot of color and edge shifts, creating a visual effect similar to an Impressionist painting. 
    The weaving process enhances this effect by layering colored yarns, resulting in a pixelated, value-shifting phenomenon. 
    <br>
    By subjecting my painted yarns to the weaving process, they become part of a patterned substrate that aligns with the Impressionists' desire to depict sensation and perception, valuing it over realism.
    <br>
    Working at the intersection of painting and weaving has an abstracting effect and makes room for expression that emphasizes the interaction of pattern, color, form, line, and texture to convey meaning.
    
    <br><br>
    
    What impact do you hope to have on those who view your artwork?
    In my work, I aim to engage viewers on multiple levels. 
    <br>
    Through painting, I tell a story and engage through color.
    Using yarn as my canvas introduces the language of tactility, drawing on the familiarity and universality of our experiences with fiber and cloth.
    The final layer is the patterning and abstraction generated by the weaving process. I use a weave structure that creates an undulating visual phenomenon and gives the illusion of movement, inviting questions about perception.

    In hindsight, what’s something you wish you knew before becoming a professional artist? 
    I wish I had known how isolating working alone in a studio every day can be. 
    The long-term impact on community building and networking presents some challenges.
    <br><br>
     
    
    What do you think is the most misunderstood aspect of being a professional artist?
    I think people are surprised to learn how similar being an artist is to being a small business owner. 
    We both have to market, network, and prospect.  We both have to file taxes, do bookkeeping, and maintain professional relationships. </p>
