    <div class="para" ><p><b>Using a unique blend of painting and silkscreen printing, Featured Artist Anna Radecka transforms intense feelings into visual experiences.
        Born in Łódź, Poland, and now creating between France and her homeland, Anna’s work dives deep into the human experience.
        <br>
        
        “The human being, his emotions, and his untold stories are the main axis of my work,” Anna Radecka explains. Through her art, she captures the raw vibrations of intense emotions, blending bitmaps, materials, and vibrant colors to bring them to life. Giving substance to an emotion and matter to memory is the very essence of Anna Radecka’s artistic research.
        <br>
        
        Working in series allows her to develop her visions based on the same motif, the same moment—as if she can stretch it out in space, pause the emotion, and examine it under a magnifying glass.
        
        Artwork Archive had the chance to chat with Anna Radecka about her creative process, what impacts she hopes her work will have, and how Artwork Archive helps her manage her art career. ​ 
        You can see more of her work on Discovery and learn more about her art practice below:

        Can you walk us through your creative process? 
        In the beginning, there is an emotion or intention. It’s not always clear, but there’s a need for me to paint it.
        <br>
        
        Sometimes, I find inspiration in textures or photos of antique and medieval sculptures. I love antique sculptures, especially the way time leaves marks on them.
        <br>
        
        Very often, I start with textures and color stains. I put myself in a meditative state, trying not to think and just letting the process flow. I apply the first layer very quickly—it's important to maintain energy and capture the essence of the feeling, so I need to work fast.
        <br>
        
        After this initial phase, I slow down and build the painting layer by layer. Sometimes this process takes a month, sometimes two or more.
        <br>
        
        The nature of my oil technique requires time.
        <br>
        <br>
        
         
        
        You use both painting and silkscreen printing in your art. How do these two mediums complement each other in expressing the emotional depth you explore?
        I use elements from my previous screen prints, making transfers to recover the textures of bitmaps and pixels.
        <br>
        
        It's quite a surprising process—there's always something unexpected! In screen printing, I work with a pixel-based system, creating and manipulating the pixels in Photoshop.
        <br>
        
        When I make my prints, I experiment a lot with transparency and layering, which creates a vibrating effect. I then mix this with oil on canvas.
        <br>
        
        The contrast between the graphic dots and the brushstrokes forms my artistic vocabulary.
        <br>

        What role does color play in your art, especially in terms of recreating the "vibrations" of intense emotions?
        Color is the carrier of emotions, so I choose the palette according to the mood I want to convey to viewers.
        <br>
        
        I build the paintings using no more than three colors—one dominates, holding everything together. Light and contrast are also two very important elements.
        <br>
        <br>
        
         
        
        What impact do you hope to have on those who view your artwork?
        I hope to create some trouble! : <br>
        
        I aim to provoke or evoke emotions of any kind.
        
        I want to make people feel.<br>
        <br>
        
         
        In hindsight, what’s something you wish you knew before becoming a professional artist? 
        I wish I had known how to keep an archive of my works, organize my art days, talk about my art, find a mentor, and determine pricing.
        <br>
